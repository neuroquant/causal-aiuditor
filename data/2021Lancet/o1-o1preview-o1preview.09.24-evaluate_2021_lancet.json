          "text": "Below is a critical appraisal of the paper by Burgess and colleagues (2021) titled “Estimating dose–response relationships for vitamin D with coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality: observational and Mendelian randomisation analyses,” focusing on potential mathematical, logical, or statistical issues as well as on overall study design and analytical soundness.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nI. Assessment of Mathematical, Logical, and Statistical Aspects\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Statistical Power and Sample Sizes  \n• The authors assembled very large cohorts for both the observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) components (over 500,000 for observational analyses and approximately 386,000 for genetic analyses).  \n• Large sample sizes confer high power, especially important for stratified MR analyses. The power should generally be sufficient to detect effects of modest size, especially in the population as a whole.  \n\n2) Nonlinear Dose-Response Modeling  \n• For the observational analysis, the paper employed fractional polynomial methods (and a check by deciles) to characterize any nonlinear associations between 25(OH)D and outcomes. These are standard and recognized approaches to explore nonlinearity.  \n• The reported curves indicated a plateau in risk reduction above a certain vitamin D threshold. That shape was consistent across sensitivity analyses.  \n• The authors clearly separated observational (potentially confounded) nonlinearity from potential causal nonlinearity. Their main MR approach used stratification by baseline 25(OH)D category (or its residual after removing genetic variation), reflecting an attempt to glean whether the MR effect might differ across baseline levels.  \n\n3) Mendelian Randomization Approach  \n• MR relies on the “instrumental variable assumptions”—chiefly that the chosen genetic variants (a) predict the exposure of interest (here, 25(OH)D) and (b) affect outcomes only through that exposure.  \n• The selected genetic instrument is composed of variants in or near loci known to be directly related to vitamin D transport/metabolism (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP24A1). This choice increases the likelihood that the instrument is specific for vitamin D.  \n• The authors tested associations of the genetic score with potential confounders in UK Biobank, finding no strong correlation except slight correlations with HDL cholesterol and BMI. This is a crucial step to rule out horizontal pleiotropy.  \n• The primary MR approach uses ratio estimates (gene–outcome / gene–exposure) combined across variants. This is a conventional MR method.  \n• They also cross-checked the robustness of estimates with sensitivity analyses that excluded variants at each locus in turn.  \n\n4) Stratification in the MR Analyses  \n• The authors stratified participants by (residual) 25(OH)D levels, then repeated genetic analyses within each stratum to examine potential causal effects at low versus high baseline 25(OH)D. Such stratification (residual-based) reduces “collider bias,” although it cannot wholly eliminate it if disease status also influences 25(OH)D.  \n• From a statistical perspective, the (residual) stratification approach is defensible so long as one interprets the results carefully (i.e., “what is the causal effect of raising 25(OH)D in individuals who, apart from genotype, have 25(OH)D in a given range?”).  \n• The modeling uncovered an inverse association with mortality for those with particularly low vitamin D status (25(OH)D <25 or <40 nmol/L, depending on the analysis).  \n\n5) Potential Multiple-Comparison Concerns  \n• The paper investigates multiple outcomes (CHD, stroke, all-cause mortality, plus cause-specific mortality). However, their main outcomes were pre-specified (major cardiovascular events and total mortality), and the consistent pattern (that only the strata with low vitamin D show MR-based associations) mitigates the worry that these are chance findings from multiple testing alone.  \n• The authors discuss the biological plausibility of the result (especially for mortality) rather than for all outcomes, which also helps address multiple-comparison concerns to some extent.  \n\n6) Potential Residual Bias or Confounding  \n• Even though Mendelian randomization reduces confounding by classical risk factors, residual confounding can occur if the genetic variants themselves have pleiotropic pathways or if the environment strongly interacts with those variants in ways not accounted for.  \n• The study acknowledges this risk and uses only variants recognized to be in vitamin D metabolism pathways. The risk of major pleiotropy is presumably low, though it cannot be fully excluded.  \n\nFrom a purely mathematical or computational perspective, there do not appear to be glaring errors in:\n• The fractional polynomial or decile-based approach for nonlinearity.  \n• The ratio-based MR approach (the standard Wald method).  \n• Meta-analysis across cohorts.  \n\nOverall, the statistical methods (observational and MR-based) are suited to addressing the core hypotheses, and the authors supply a thorough series of secondary and sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of results.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nII. Soundness of the Study Design and Ability to Address the Questions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Data Sources and Cohort Selection  \n• The authors drew from multiple large, prospective cohorts in Europe (UK Biobank, EPIC-CVD, and the Copenhagen studies) plus additional cohorts for observational analysis (the VitDSC collaboration).  \n• They excluded participants with a known history of coronary heart disease or stroke at baseline for the incidence analyses, which is standard.  \n• As with many large consortia, there is a possibility of heterogeneity in measurement methods for 25(OH)D across laboratories. However, the authors adjusted measurements seasonally and stratified them carefully, which partially addresses technical variation.  \n\n2) Observational vs. Genetic Approaches  \n• The use of both conventional observational analyses and MR in the same paper is a strong design choice. The observational component revealed a non-linear association, and the MR component tested whether the associations might be causal.  \n• The design effectively demonstrates that null results from population-wide MR might mask important subgroup effects if only those with low 25(OH)D experience meaningful mortality benefit.  \n\n3) Examination of Non-Cardiovascular Outcomes  \n• The paper also considered all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality stratified by cardiovascular, cancer, and other sources. This allows for exploration of any protective relationship beyond vascular events.  \n• The authors interpret the inverse association with all-cause mortality in low vitamin D strata carefully, noting potential roles in multiple organ systems, not just cardiovascular.  \n\n4) Confounding Structures and Limitations  \n• Mendelian randomization improves causal inference, but the study does not have repeated longitudinal measures of 25(OH)D in each participant. The authors rely on a single baseline 25(OH)D measure, which may not perfectly represent an individual’s usual lifetime vitamin D status.  \n• The authors properly acknowledge that genetics reflect lifelong exposure, whereas supplementation trials last only a few years, which might explain discrepancies between MR findings and typical null results of short-term supplementation trials.  \n• The study population is limited to individuals of European ancestry. While this helps to avoid population stratification problems, it limits external generalizability to other ancestral groups, some of whom have large proportions of low vitamin D.  \n• Although the authors mention the possibility that low 25(OH)D could reflect poor overall health or other vulnerabilities, the MR approach reduces (but cannot absolutely eliminate) this concern.\n\nOverall, the design leverages strong methods: large-scale observational data to characterize shapes of association, combined with a well-chosen, biologically relevant genetic instrument for MR to test causal hypotheses. The paper’s analytical strategies (fractional polynomials for nonlinearity, ratio estimates for MR, stratification by baseline 25(OH)D) are appropriately matched to the scientific question: “Does vitamin D causally lower risk of cardiovascular disease or mortality, especially in individuals with low vitamin D status?”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIII. Overall Conclusions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• The paper’s statistical approach is generally solid: the large sample sizes, rigorous meta-analytic methods, fractional polynomial curves for nonlinearity, and careful use of a biologically targeted genetic score lend credibility to the results. \n• No major mathematical or statistical errors are evident; indeed, the analyses employ standard, widely accepted techniques. \n• The main potential hazards—such as heterogeneous assays, limitations in generalizability to non-European ancestries, incomplete ability to address some forms of pleiotropy—are adequately discussed by the authors. \n• The approach of combining observational and MR analyses within the same dataset is a strong design that increases the paper’s ability to address the core scientific question about causality and thresholds. \n\nIn sum, the study is well designed to determine whether low vitamin D status contributes causally to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Despite recognized limitations and the usual caution that MR captures lifelong exposure rather than short-term supplementation, the design and statistical methods are appropriate and sufficiently robust to support the conclusions offered by the authors.",

          "text": "Below is a brief critique of the article, focusing on potential mathematical, logical, or statistical concerns and the overall soundness of the study design and its ability to address the primary scientific question.\n\n1) Study Objectives and Overall Design  \n• The study combines two approaches––a large observational analysis (pooled individual‑participant data) and Mendelian randomization (MR)––to investigate the relationships between 25‑hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and major health outcomes (coronary heart disease, stroke, all‑cause mortality).  \n• Overall, the two‑pronged design is appropriate and relatively robust. The observational analyses identify apparent non‑linear dose‑response relationships, while stratified MR analyses attempt to infer causality.  \n• The goal is clear: to disentangle confounding from a truly causal effect and to examine, in particular, whether benefits of vitamin D might be limited to individuals with low serum concentrations.\n\n2) Mathematical and Statistical Methods  \na) Observational Analyses:  \n• Fractional polynomial meta‑analysis for dose–response (as shown in their Figures 1 and S1):  \n  – This approach is standard for detecting and modeling non‑linear relationships, and it is well‑founded.  \n  – The authors appear to have carefully tested for nonlinearity by visually inspecting or plotting hazard ratios (HRs) against 25(OH)D.  \n  – Random‑effects meta‑analysis was used to combine study‑specific estimates, which is generally the correct choice when there is potential heterogeneity across cohorts.  \n• Covariate Adjustment:  \n  – Adjusting for baseline age, BMI, smoking, lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, etc., is appropriate in large observational data. Residual confounding is, as always, possible but they employ standard epidemiologic practice.  \n  – Seasonality adjustment was done by shifting measurements to an “autumn‑equivalent,” which appears a reasonable attempt to handle variation in sunlight exposure.\n\nb) Mendelian Randomization (MR):  \n• Genetic Instrument:  \n  – The authors use a set of polymorphisms in GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1, which are known to be related specifically to vitamin D transport, metabolism, or synthesis. This focused selection is a strength, because it mitigates some of the pleiotropy risks that arise if one used purely genome‑wide hits.  \n  – They stepwise selected variants and ended up with 21 variants (in UK Biobank/EPIC‑CVD) or 3 in the Danish cohorts (due to availability). Notice that having fewer variants in the Danish cohorts can reduce power but should not itself produce bias in the combined analysis, provided the final meta‑analysis accounts for standard errors properly.  \n• Ratio Estimates:  \n  – The MR effect estimates were computed by taking genetic associations with outcome divided by genetic associations with 25(OH)D (scaled to 10 nmol/L). This “ratio method” or “Wald ratio” is standard.  \n  – They properly adjusted for principal components of ancestry to reduce confounding from population structure.  \n• Stratification on Residual 25(OH)D:  \n  – Stratifying the sample by measured 25(OH)D can introduce collider bias into genetic analyses if not handled carefully. Here, the authors stratify on residual vitamin D concentrations (observed 25(OH)D after removing the genetic component), which is one way to minimize such bias. They also note that the correlation of “residual 25(OH)D” with measured 25(OH)D is very high, so interpretation remains straightforward.  \n  – Within each stratum, they re‑estimate the MR effect to examine potential nonlinearity or threshold effects from a causal standpoint. This is a relatively novel and increasingly used approach to test whether MR effects differ across baseline concentrations. Conceptually, it is well argued.\n\n3) Potential Concerns or Limitations  \n• Residual Confounding in Observational Data: Despite fairly comprehensive adjustment, some confounding in the observational analyses might remain. The authors do acknowledge this and rely on MR as a more robust approach to causality.  \n• MR Assumptions and Pleiotropy:  \n  – Even though they used variants with good biological specificity, CYP24A1 is known to be associated with circulating calcium levels. That could be a mild source of horizontal pleiotropy; they note it as well. Nonetheless, they tested a sensitivity approach excluding each gene region; only exclusion of CYP2R1 had a noticeable effect on mortality estimates, reinforcing that at least the other regions are not driving large pleiotropic biases.  \n  – The authors also present a genome‑wide score but identify some pleiotropic associations (for instance, with lipids). They therefore focus on the narrower, biologically focused set of variants for their main results, which is valid.  \n• Power in Subgroup Analyses: While the overall sample is large, dividing participants into strata by “deficient,” “insufficient,” etc. 25(OH)D categories lowers event counts in each category. However, they still appear to have enough events in the “deficient” categories, especially for all‑cause mortality, to show fairly precise confidence intervals. For stroke or coronary heart disease in the deficient groups, confidence intervals are somewhat wider (as they point out).  \n• Generalizability: Because they restricted themselves mostly to individuals of European ancestry, the question remains whether these relationships hold in other ancestry groups, especially populations that might have darker skin pigmentation or different sun‑exposure norms.\n\n4) Strength of Conclusions and Overall Soundness  \n• The study addresses its central hypothesis––whether vitamin D’s association with cardiovascular disease and mortality might be causal and whether supplementation is most relevant in those with low levels––through carefully executed observational plus MR analyses.  \n• Statistically, the combination of the large pooled observational data and stratified MR approach is for the most part well designed to detect nonlinearity and potential threshold effects. They find supportive evidence of a potentially causal association only in those with 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L (and possibly up to ~40&nbsp;nmol/L).  \n• The authors openly acknowledge limitations (possibility of pleiotropy, short‑term versus lifetime differences in vitamin D, minimal representation of non‑European‑ancestry populations).  \n• The overall design is relatively robust and does align with the question of whether (and at what threshold) vitamin D supplementation might reduce cardiovascular or mortality risk. The fact that only individuals with deficient levels showed a strong MR effect is consistent with a threshold phenomenon that standard randomized trials (many of which enroll people in a wide range of vitamin D status) may have underpowered or were insufficiently targeted to detect.\n\nSummary  \n• Mathematical/Statistical Consistency: The analyses do not exhibit obvious mathematical or statistical flaws; rather, they employ widely accepted state‑of‑the‑art methods (fractional polynomials, inverse‑variance weighted meta‑analysis, ratio‑based MR, stratification on residuals to address nonlinearity).  \n• Logical Coherence: The attempts to carefully rule out pleiotropy and residual confounding are appropriate. The authors’ approach in focusing on biologically relevant variants, testing associations with potential confounders, and running sensitivity analyses strengthens confidence in their findings.  \n• Study Soundness: The design successfully combines observational dose–response analyses with MR to tease out potential causality and effect thresholds. The main limitation remains that definitive clinical conclusions (especially regarding supplementation in non‑European ethnicity) would still require a large, long‑term, and targeted randomized trial. However, the authors’ overall approach is methodologically sound and helps to clarify and quantify the role of vitamin D deficiency in cardiovascular risk and mortality.",

This evaluation will assess the study for mathematical, logical, or statistical errors and evaluate the overall soundness of the study design and analysis.\n\n**Summary of the Study:**\n\n- **Objective:** To characterize the dose-response relationships between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality using observational and <span class=\"delve __shimmer__\">Mendelian randomization analyses</span>.\n- **Methods:**\n  - **Observational Analysis:** Utilized data from 33 prospective studies with 500,962 individuals without prior coronary heart disease or stroke.\n  - **Mendelian Randomization (MR) Analysis:** Employed genetic data from four population-based cohort studies (UK Biobank, EPIC-CVD, and two Copenhagen studies) comprising 386,406 individuals of <span class=\"delve __shimmer__\">European ancestry</span>.\n  - **Outcomes:** Primary outcomes were coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality.\n- **Findings:**\n  - Observational analyses suggested inverse associations between 25(OH)D concentrations and the outcomes, particularly at low vitamin D levels.\n  - Population-wide MR analyses showed no significant associations between genetically predicted 25(OH)D levels and the outcomes.\n  - Stratified MR analyses indicated a strong inverse association between genetically predicted 25(OH)D and all-cause mortality in individuals with vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D <25 nmol/L).\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation of the Study Design and Analysis:**\n\n1. **Study Design:**\n\n   - **Strengths:**\n     - **Large Sample Size:** The study leverages data from sizable cohorts, enhancing statistical power.\n     - **Combination of Observational and MR Analyses:** This approach attempts to address causality, with MR providing a tool to mitigate confounding in observational studies.\n     - **Focus on Dose-Response Relationships:** The study aims to characterize how different levels of vitamin D relate to health outcomes, which is valuable for public health guidance.\n\n   - **Weaknesses:**\n     - **Potential for Bias in Stratified MR Analyses:** Stratifying MR analyses based on levels of the exposure (vitamin D) or its residuals may introduce <span class=\"delve __shimmer__\">collider bias</span>, compromising the validity of causal inferences.\n     - **Population Limitation:** The study is restricted to individuals of European ancestry, limiting generalizability to other populations, especially those with higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.\n     - **<span class=\"delve __shimmer__\">Assay Variability</span>:** Differences in vitamin D assay methods across studies could introduce measurement error or heterogeneity.\n\n2. **Statistical Analysis:**\n\n   - **Observational Analysis:**\n     - **Adjustment for Confounders:** The models appropriately adjust for conventional risk factors.\n     - **Non-linear Modelling:** Use of <span class=\"delve __shimmer__\">fractional polynomials</span> to model potential non-linear relationships is appropriate.\n     - **Findings:** The inverse association at low vitamin D levels aligns with previous research.\n\n   - **Mendelian Randomization Analysis:**\n     - **Instrument Selection:** Genetic variants were chosen from genes involved in vitamin D metabolism (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP24A1), which is appropriate to minimize horizontal pleiotropy.\n     - **Statistical Methodology:** The ratio method is standard in MR analyses.\n     - **Issue of Stratification:**\n       - **Collider Bias Risk:** Stratifying on <span class=\"delve __shimmer__\">residual 25(OH)D</span> (which is influenced by confounders) can induce collider bias. This occurs because the stratification variable (residual 25[OH]D) is conditioned on the outcome (mortality), potentially creating a spurious association.\n       - **Correlation with Confounders:** Residual 25(OH)D may still correlate with unmeasured confounders, violating MR assumptions.\n     - **Sensitivity Analyses:** The study performed sensitivity analyses excluding certain genetic variants, but the impact of collider bias from stratification remains a concern.\n\n   - **Statistical Significance and Effect Sizes:**\n     - **Large Effect Size in Deficient Group:** The reported OR of 0.69 per 10 nmol/L increase in vitamin D in deficient individuals is substantially large and may overestimate the true effect due to bias.\n     - **Multiple Comparisons:** With numerous analyses and stratifications, there's an increased risk of type I errors (false positives) unless adjustments are made.\n\n3. **Assumptions of Mendelian Randomization Not Fully Met:**\n\n   - **Relevance (Strength of Genetic Instrument):** Genetic variants explain a modest proportion of variance in vitamin D levels, which may limit the power of MR analyses.\n   - **Independence:** Stratification could violate the independence assumption, as the strata might differ systematically in other risk factors.\n   - **Exclusion Restriction:** The genetic variants should not influence the outcome except through vitamin D levels. If residual 25(OH)D is correlated with confounders, this assumption may be violated.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n\n   - **Consistency Between Observational and Genetic Findings:** The discrepancy between overall MR results (null findings) and stratified MR results (significant findings in deficient individuals) raises questions.\n   - **Interpretation of Stratified Results:** The conclusion that vitamin D supplementation could reduce mortality risk in deficient individuals relies on the validity of stratified MR analyses, which is questionable due to potential biases.\n\n5. **Conclusions and Implications:**\n\n   - **Conclusions May Be Overstated:** Given the methodological concerns, particularly with stratified MR analyses, the assertion of a causal relationship may not be fully justified.\n   - **Implications for Trials:** Recommending vitamin D supplementation trials specifically targeting individuals with low vitamin D levels is reasonable, but the evidence provided may not be strong enough to warrant changes in public health policy at this time.\n\n---\n\n**Potential Errors and Limitations:**\n\n- **Mathematical/Statistical Errors:**\n  - **Collider Bias in Stratified MR Analyses:** Stratifying on residuals of the exposure can introduce bias. This could lead to incorrect causal inferences.\n  - **Overestimation of Effect Sizes:** The large effect observed in the deficient stratum may be inflated due to bias.\n  - **Assumption Violations:** MR relies on strong assumptions that may not hold in stratified analyses.\n\n- **Design Limitations:**\n  - **Generalizability:** The study population is limited to individuals of European ancestry, reducing applicability to other groups.\n  - **Measurement Error:** Variation in vitamin D assay methods could impact the consistency of exposure assessment.\n  - **Unmeasured Confounders:** Residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out, especially in observational analyses.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the study provides valuable observational data suggesting an inverse association between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality, the causal inference drawn from the stratified Mendelian randomization analyses is potentially flawed due to methodological concerns.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Potential for Collider Bias:** Stratifying MR analyses based on residual vitamin D levels may introduce bias, invalidating causal conclusions.\n- **Validity of MR Assumptions:** The necessary MR assumptions (relevance, independence, exclusion restriction) may not hold in the stratified analyses.\n- **Overstated Conclusions:** Given the limitations, the conclusion of a causal relationship between vitamin D deficiency and mortality risk is not fully supported.\n- **Recommendation for Caution:** Interpretations and policy recommendations should be made cautiously, acknowledging the study's limitations.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe study's attempt to explore the causal relationship between vitamin D levels and health outcomes is commendable, but methodological weaknesses, particularly in the MR analyses, limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Further research using robust MR methods without stratification-induced bias is needed to clarify the causal role of vitamin D in these health outcomes.",
